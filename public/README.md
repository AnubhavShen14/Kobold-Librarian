The images used for the website are not our property, and therefore excluded from the repo. If you wish to use the CSS, either make it point to the live instance of The Scribe, or provide your own.

Additionally, the guide.html that's pointed to by the 'help' command is not provided either. This is supposed to be a specific guide for the instance you're running, and should be custom-made for your bot.
